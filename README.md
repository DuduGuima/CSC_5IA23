# CSC_5AI23_TA Project

Final project for the Computer Vision at ENSTA. The main task was to use Kaggle's [Wildfire Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdelghaniaaba/wildfire-prediction-dataset), with the constraint of not using the training partition's labels.

The two main approaches used here were taken from [FixMatch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07685) and [End-to-End learning with Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00362).

The group is composed by:
- Eduardo Guimaraes 
- Filipe Lacerda Benevides
- Joaquim Minarelli Gaspar
- Sami Kouzeiha


The trained models are contained in the <em>models</em> folder, with the exception of those that are quickly trained on the spot: The conventional CNN networks and the fine-tuning of the encoders, due to the constraints GitHub poses on transferring large files.
